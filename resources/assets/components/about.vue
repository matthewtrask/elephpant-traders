                    <p>What started as a tweet has morphed into this site. Credit goes to Colin O'Dell for the initial idea, and letting me run with it.</p>
                    <p>This is a completely open source project, passphrases not included. If you see something you think could be different, open an issue!</p>
                    <p>If you are feeling froggy, you can make a PR against the current code base. I just ask that you branch off what will soon be a develop branch.</p>
                    <p>If you or your company would like to help cover some server costs, that would be absolutely wonderful, and you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewtrask">twitter to talk!</a></p>
